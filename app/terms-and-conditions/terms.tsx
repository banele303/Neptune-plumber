        Unless there&apos;s a prior agreement, full payment is expected when the work

        needs to pay the entire quoted amount, subtracting any payments already
        made. If no quote was given, the company&apos;s representative will inform
        the customer of the payable amount.

      </h3>
      <p className="text-[18px] md:text-[24px] test-slate-300 py-6">
        All work estimates will be based on the details provided by the customer
        to The Company. If there are changes to the work after the estimate has
        been given but before the work starts, a new estimate will be provided
        for approval. If changes occur after the work has started, a set price
        to cover these changes will be agreed upon between The Company and the
        customer and added to the final bill. If the requirements change due to
        lack of information, discovered defects in existing installations, etc.,
        the customer will be responsible for any extra costs. Estimates will be
        valid for customer acceptance for one month after they are issued and
        work should start within two months from the estimate date, otherwise, a
        new estimate will be needed.

        Estimates are given based solely on our best efforts. Unless the
        customer has been given a fixed price quote (as mentioned above), the
        cost of the work will be determined by the price of the parts supplied
        by The Company, in addition to labor costs. Labor costs will be
        calculated hourly or partially hourly and may include the time spent on
        researching, sourcing, and buying any provided materials.

        work, services, or fittings that may be required to address any
        unforeseen events or situations that occur during the work process and
        are beyond The Company&apos;s control. The Company is not accountable for

        any damage or injury caused by the customer or other household members

        Please be aware that our terms require immediate payment upon completion
        of services. We accept cash on delivery (COD) or electronic funds

        done via SMS confirmation or email. Our staff will not leave the
        premises until full payment or proof of payment has been received.
        Clients using EFT must provide their ID number. All installed materials
        remain the property of the Company until the account is fully settled.
        If the account is not settled in accordance with our COD terms, all

        costs of both installation and removal, as well as any legal costs
        incurred
